                    <h2>What is PureDine?</h2>
                    <p>PureDine is a system that allows users to search for restaurants in their area, and filter the results based on the user's allergies.</p>
                    <p>To use PureDine, one must start by typing a Restaurant, City, or Zip Code into the main page search bar.</p>
                    <p>After the user has entered their search, they can then filter the results based on their resturants and their menus.</p>
                    <p>Once a menu is found, a user can select allergies from checkboxes and the program will sort the menu to provide basic allergy guides on what is safe and not safe to eat.</p>
