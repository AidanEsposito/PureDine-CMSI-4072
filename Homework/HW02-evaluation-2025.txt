Comments:
---------

problem 5-8 you need a stop state.  Also, what about fractional exponents?
   For example, 2.34e-1.5 ...

problem 6.2 you did a pretty good job here, but there are some things to
   consider.  First, the 'subclass' drawing arrows should point to the
   superclass, not to the subclass.  Second, you need a couple more classes
   on the diagram ~ a 'Fillable' class which is for the shapes, and another
   'LineDrawable' class for things that have a line but aren't fillable.
   The 'Text' class should be by itself and a direct subclass of the
   'Drawable' class at the top of the hierarchy.

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
