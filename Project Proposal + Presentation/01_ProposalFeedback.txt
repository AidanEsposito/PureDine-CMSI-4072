Project Proposal Feedback
Project: PureDine
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Nice job on the document.  You hit all the required ideas.  I like the
   choice of project ~ something that will help people in general but with
   an eye to people that have specific limitations.  Very good idea.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Very nice-looking and well-crafted presentation, Aidan!  I like all your
   graphics and the layout and color scheme is nice.

   One thing to consider is, on slide two you have the description of the
   project as the second bullet, and the components as the first bullet.  I
   think it would be better to have the first bullet point actuall be moved
   to the last bullet so the audience understands what you proposing and how
   it will benefit them, THEN say what it is made of.

   All the bullets could be a bit closer together, too, on all your slides.

   Your questions slide is VERY cool!

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester.
